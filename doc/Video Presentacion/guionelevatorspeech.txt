FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND.

That is the number of small businesses in our country.
And approximately, 20% of those businesses will be closing this year
due to the growing service of online shopping, since the majority of this
service is owned by large international companies.

We are the blue team and we present LocalMarket.

What is this this app about?

LocalMarket is an app designed to promote the small businesses in our country.
It allows users to have a better perspective of every local shop in their area,
as well as give small owners a chance to advertise their businesses.

This app wants to shrink the space between the local shops and the user,
space which keeps getting bigger due to the power of big companies
and the lack of resources from the small businesses.

How does it work?

After logging in, the user is sent to the main page, where a tab of news is shown.
In this page, the user can filter for categories, use the searchbar or see their last
viewed shops.

Once the shop is selected, the user has a much more detailed page about the business.
It shows its location, products, description and of course, reviews from other users.

From the owners perspective, a lot of options are shown, such as add or delete new products,
create new shops, and changing the aspect of the shops pages.

-------

In conclusion, Local Market offers a whole new world to small businnesses and promotes
quality, local and sustainable shopping.
